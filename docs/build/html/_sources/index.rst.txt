Welcome to Duplexity's documentation!
=====================================

**Duplexity** is a Python package that provides a set of deterministic and probabilistic metrics for 
evaluating the performance of machine learning models. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide a wide 
range of metrics for comparing data sets

..note::
   This project is still in the early development stages. This means the code is 
   constantly changing, and we currently don't guarantee backwards compatibility 
   when changes are made. Once a stable release of Duplexity is available, we will
   upload Duplexity to PyPI to make it pip-installable.
