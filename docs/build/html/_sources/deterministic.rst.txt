Deterministic Metrics
=====================

Deterministic metrics are metrics that are calculated in a deterministic way. 
This means that the same metric will always be calculated in the same way, regardless of the order in which the data is processed. 
This is important because it allows us to compare the results of different metrics and to ensure that the results are consistent.

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   Mean Squared Error measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.

    .. autofunction:: duplexity.deterministic_score.mean_squared_error

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
.. autofunction:: duplexity.deterministic_score.mean_absolute_error

3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
.. autofunction:: duplexity.deterministic_score.root_mean_squared_error

4. Bias
.. autofunction:: duplexity.deterministic_score.bias

5. Debiased Root Mean Squared Error
.. autofunction:: duplexity.deterministic_score.debiased_root_mean_squared_error

6. Pearson Correlation Coefficient
